### Platform for buying food that restaurants waste.

This project is part of personal journey to remind myself of the technologies that I have either forgotten or yet not so good in.
____________________
## Goal

Build a functioning website to buy food that restaurants waste. 

### The platform should be able to handle the following:
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] User authorization
- [ ] Restaurants can add food to the platform
- [ ] User can buy food from the platform
- [ ] Chat between users and restaurants
- [ ] Loyalty system

### Backend should include (but not limited to):
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Push messages
- [ ] Containerization
- [ ] Load balancer
- [ ] Integration tests

(not that a small project like this needs several of them, but I want to go over the process)
