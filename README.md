### The platform should handle the following:
- Restaurants can add food to the platform
- Users can buy food from the platform
- Users can give feedback to the restaurants
- Loyalty system
- Chat system between users and restaurants (maybe lol)

### Backend should handle:
- Logging
- High throughput
- High availability
- High scalability
- Security

### Code should be
- Tested (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documented
- Maintainable
